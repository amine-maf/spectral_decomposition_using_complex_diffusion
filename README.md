# Spectral Decomposition in Networks 🌐

## Overview 📑
This project explores spectral decomposition techniques for network analysis, integrating complex diffusion and quantum random walk approaches. It focuses on extracting structural properties of graphs through their spectral characteristics, with applications such as triangle counting.

## Technical Details 🛠️

### Spectral Decomposition 📊
Spectral decomposition involves breaking down a graph’s matrix (e.g., adjacency or Laplacian) into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This process reveals the graph's intrinsic properties, such as connectivity and clustering, by analyzing the spectrum of the matrix.

### Complex Diffusion 🌊
Complex diffusion extends traditional diffusion models by introducing complex-valued dynamics. It captures the evolution of network states over time, emphasizing spectral components influenced by a complex diffusion parameter.

### Quantum Random Walks ⚛️
Quantum random walks utilize unitary evolution operators derived from the graph’s structure, enabling interference effects that highlight subtle network features. This contrasts with classical random walks by providing a quantum perspective on spectral properties.

### Triangle Counting via Spectral Methods 🔺
Triangle counting leverages the graph’s spectral properties, where the sum of the cubed eigenvalues relates to the number of triangles. This method provides a mathematical link between the spectrum and local clustering, useful for assessing network robustness and community structures.
